# **News Article Similarity Analysis with GloVe Embeddings**

## **Overview**

This project analyzes the similarity between news articles by leveraging **GloVe word embeddings**, **PCA** for dimensionality reduction, and **KMeans clustering** for grouping articles with similar topics. The project also generates **word clouds** for each cluster, providing visual insights into the most frequent terms in each group.

## Data Source
The news article dataset was sourced from Mage AI's public datasets repository:

`news_articles.csv` - Source: [Mage AI Datasets](https://github.com/mage-ai/datasets)

## **Key Features**

- **Preprocessing**: Lower casing, tokenization and cleaning of article texts (removal of stopwords and non-alphabetic tokens).
- **GloVe Embeddings**: Utilizes pre-trained GloVe word vectors to represent words in articles as dense vectors.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA is applied to reduce the high-dimensional word vectors to 2D for visualization.
- **Clustering**: K-Means with elbow method optimization is used to cluster news articles based on their GloVe embeddings.
- **Visualization**: Interactive scatter plots of the clusters and word clouds for each group.

## **Technologies Used**

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn (for PCA and KMeans)
- WordCloud
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for plotting)
